Usage: cp file1 file2
  file1 is file to be encode/decoded 
  file2 is output 

Encode file by:
  1. Read in file and check for empty files
  2. Count frequencies of characters and create nodes for each 
  3. Sort the files in order of frequency using q sort
  4. Create a linked list of the nodes
  5. Create a Huffman tree from linked list 
  6. Create Huffman codes for each character 
  7. Return Huffman codes of each character  
  8. Create header using char freq
  9. Create Body using huffman codes for each character

Decode file by: 
  1. Read in header to recieve number of characters and frequency 
  2. Sort the files in order of frequency using q sort
  3. Create a linked list of the nodes
  4. Create a Huffman tree from linked list 
  5. Create Huffman codes for each character 
  6. Return Huffman codes of each character 
  7. Use body of encoded message to decrypt body
