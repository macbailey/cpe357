--Notes--
We were unable to complete a working program. 
We commented our logic throughout the code and built a hash table infrastructure. 
Our goal was to read in from a file using read long line, pass word for creation of a node and
insertion into a hash table. The hash table used quadratic probing with horner hash algorithim, 
if the bit size became equal to our original table size we would re-allocate memory to double the
size and continue reading values. Once the table was full there will be sorting function to grab 
the top 10 frequent words using ASCII value to break ties.
