———Questions———
1. Which machine did you choose? (Hint:hostname(1)will tell you.)
	- My local machine 
2. Which manual page did you read? Did you learn anything useful?
	- man SSH: I learned about using different additives for the ssh, most interesting was the verbose mode  	 (ssh -v) which allowed debugging messages to be printed during the process 
3. Which editor did you choose? Why? (Some people feel very strongly about theireditors...)
	- I used vi, I have never used vi before and I have heard that it is used quite often in the professional field 
4. What is your program supposed to do? Did you encounter any problems while developing it? If so, what were they and how did you solve them??
	- It is supposed to print out the statement “Hello World!”, I ran into no problems beyond a small learning 	  curve with vi editor, which I remedied by looking up a vi cheat sheet.
