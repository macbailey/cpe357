1. (Warm up) Please provide declarations for the following data:

	(a) a pointercpthat points to achar.
	(b) a pointerapthat points to an array ofchars.
	(c) a pointerppthat points to a pointer that points to anint.

2. Is it possible in C to declare and initialize a pointer thatpoints to itself? Why or why not?(And, if so,how,of course.)

3. What is the fundamental problem with the following code fragment intended to print out astring:

	char s[] = "Hello, world!\n";
	char *p;
	for(p = s; p != ’\0’; p++)
		putchar(*p);

	What will happen when this is executed? How can it be fixed?

4. C programmers often say “arrays are the same as pointers”.In one sense this is true.  Inanother, more correct, sense they are fundamentally different.

	(a) In what ways is this statement correct?
	(b) How is it in error? That is, what makes a pointer fundamentally different from an array?
