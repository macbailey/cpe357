1. (Warm up) Please provide declarations for the following data:

	(a) a pointer cp that points to a char.
		char *cp; 
	(b) a pointer ap that points to an array of chars.
		char[] *ap;
	(c) a pointer pp that points to a pointer that points to an int.
		int *x; 
		int *pp; 
		pp = &x; 

2. Is it possible in C to declare and initialize a pointer that points to itself? Why or why not?(And, if so,how,of course.)
	yes, it is possible using pointers we can point to any memory. Even though it is not very useful or practical. 
	ex:
	int *x (int*)&x; 



3. What is the fundamental problem with the following code fragment intended to print out astring:

	char s[] = "Hello, world!\n";
	char *p;
	for(p = s; p != ’\0’; p++)
		putchar(*p);

	What will happen when this is executed? How can it be fixed?

4. C programmers often say “arrays are the same as pointers”.In one sense this is true.  Inanother, more correct, sense they are fundamentally different.

	(a) In what ways is this statement correct?
	(b) How is it in error? That is, what makes a pointer fundamentally different from an array?
